Some of the most popular IDEs are: NetBeans, Eclipse, Codenvy, Delphi, Xcode, JDeveloper
===================================="NetBeans"============================================
NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing primarily with Java, 
but also with other languages, in particular PHP, C/C++, and HTML5.[3] It is also an 
application platform framework for Java desktop applications and others. The NetBeans IDE 
is written in Java and can run on Windows, OS X, Linux, Solaris and other platforms 
supporting a compatible JVM.

===================================="Eclipse"=============================================
Written mostly in Java, Eclipse can be used to develop applications. By means of various plug-ins, 
Eclipse may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages: Ada, ABAP, C, C++,
COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails 
framework), Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Scheme, and Erlang. It can also be used to develop packages 
for the software Mathematica.

===================================="Codenvy"=============================================
Codenvy is a SAAS developer environment, also known as a cloud Integrated Development Environment (IDE), 
that allows developers to create hosted environments optimized for creating, editing, compiling, testing 
and debugging applications authored in different programming languages. A SAAS developer environment has 
many clients, and can be accessed directly from within a browser, through an Application Programming 
Interface (API), or a traditional desktop IDE.

===================================="Delphi"==============================================
Delphi is an integrated development environment (IDE) for console, desktop graphical, web,
and mobile applications. Delphi's compilers use their own Object Pascal dialect of Pascal

OS X, iOS and Android.

===================================="Xcode"===============================================
Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) containing a suite of software development
tools developed by Apple for developing software for OS X and iOS. First released in 2003, the 
latest stable release is version 5.0 and is available via the Mac App Store free of charge for 
Mac OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion users.

===================================="JDeveloper"==========================================
JDeveloper is a freeware IDE supplied by Oracle Corporation. It offers features for development 
in Java, XML, SQL and PL/SQL, HTML, JavaScript, BPEL and PHP. JDeveloper covers the full development 
lifecycle from design through coding, debugging, optimization and profiling to deploying.
